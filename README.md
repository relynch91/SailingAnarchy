Sailing Sanctuary utilizes React Redux in the Frontend to be able to maintain and update state for platform. In the backend, Rails Version is used to orchestrate the Model and Controller portions of the MVC Framework.  Lastly, PostgreSQL is used as the database management system for the app.  The application deploys both model level validations as well as implementing database constraints to ensure all application data is present and formatted correctly.

As the main function of the site is to provide an online forum platform for users, scalabilty across multiple types of media screens is extremely important.  Users need to be able to make and respond to forms that are scalable across a wide variety of screen sizes.  A good deal time was utilized to understanding and developing a working flexbox model for the main application features.  It is important that screens appropriately display all field titles and associating text boxes in an ordealy fashion across a number of different screen sizes.
